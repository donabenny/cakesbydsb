      Whenever I get a craving for a tasty old-fashioned treat, I make this
      cake. Great cooks in my family have been baking it for generations, and
      their families have been enjoying the wonderful spice flavor and rich
      frosting.This impressive hummingbird cake is my dad’s favorite, so I
      always make it for his birthday. It makes a memorable dessert for any
      celebration and is lovely with a summer meal.
